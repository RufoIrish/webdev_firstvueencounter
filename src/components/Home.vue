      These days, a large number of the inhabitants in our community don't have any thoughts regarding the status
      <br />
      <br />of our compelling force of nature. There is still no efficient information for people to submit reports or
      request
      <br />
      <br />for the betterment of their place and be part of environmental activities or program. And people
      are not
      <br />
      <br />aware of some environmental programs or seminars because they are not notified about it.
