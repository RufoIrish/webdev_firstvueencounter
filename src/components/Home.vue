      These days, a large number of the inhabitants in our community don't have any thoughts regarding the status
 
     of our compelling force of nature. There is still no efficient information for people to submit reports or
      request
  
     for the betterment of their place and be part of environmental activities or program. And people
      are not
     
      aware of some environmental programs or seminars because they are not notified about it.
